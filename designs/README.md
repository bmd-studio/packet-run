# Packet Run — Design
This directory shall contain all designed elements that are made in connection
with Packet Run, whether they're visual designs, mechnical designs or 3D
designs.

NOTE: Git is our version management. Overwrite previous files with newer
versions, rather than adding them under a new filename.

# Print tasklist
All files for 3d printing can be found inside the stl directory. Double check with Tijs whether the part is ready for print.

# Uploading and Review
All designs need to be reviewed by Tijs.
- Make sure all sketches are 'locked'
- Make sure that multipart/multi-body are split in seperate files _and_ there is an assembly file.
