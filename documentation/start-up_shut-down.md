# D2-Start-up and shutdown guide

## PACKET RUN

This guide will give instructions on how Packet Run should be started at the beginning of a day, and how it should be shutdown at the end of one. When you run into issues, consult the Troubleshooting Guide, which lists common issues and how to resolve them.

## Starting up Packet Run

1. Power the installation.

Connect the power plug from the desk to a power source, probably located in the desk as well. All terminals and the Mac mini should boot automatically.

2. Ensure that all terminals have booted properly.

They should be displaying their regular terminal screen (the grey one).

3. Ensure all NFC scanners are working.

Take a ball, and place them on the scanner for each terminal. The screen should display "Invalid packet detected" when the ball is placed on the scanner.

4. Ensure the installation is working.

Make two full runs throughout the installation to ensure the installation is working as expected.

## Shutting down Packet Run
Remove power from the installation.
