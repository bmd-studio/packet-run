# Packet Run Track List
This page contains all tracks in Packet Run.

Note that the numbering consists of two numbers. The T-prefix denotes the
terminal number for the track (1-12, counterclockwise, starting at desk),
whereas the S-prefix denotes the slot (1-4, left to right as seen from
front-side of terminal). Sending side slots consist of the holes at the top of a
terminal, whereas receiving side slots are on the bottom rear section of there
terminal. 

Each track contains multiple track segments (1-4, counted from sending
side). All track segments are labeled, where the track segment is denoted with a
P-prefix. 

Lastly, tracks are sorted into a build order category (1-3). This
signifies which tracks should be installed first (1), middle (2) and last (3).
During teardown, the build order should be reversed (3 first, 2 middle, 1 last).
