## Deconstruction

Deconstructing the installation should be done in the following order, as some parts may not be properly accessible until other parts are removed first.

### Removing the desk

Firstly, remove any and all cables that connect the desk to the installation. Remove the ethernet cables from the router (leave them on the ground for now). Also remove both ethernet cables that are directly plugged in to the Mac mini. Store the ethernet cable that has the dongle attached to it in the desk. Remove the power cord that powers the installation from the socket and coil it up on the inside of the desk. Lastly, remove the power cable coming in from terminal 11 from the power socket inside the desk.

Secondly, disconnect both tracks that are attached to the desk. The one under the desk should be freely floating, so you can remove it and put it on the ground for later removal. The outgoing track is bolted to the desk, and you will need to disconnect it in order to remove the desk. Remove the bolts in the track using an M3 Allan wrench. After removing the track, make sure to screw the bolts back in the mount, so that we don't lose them.

Lastly, keep the peripherals in place using painter's tape. This goes particularly for the keyboard. If you see mouse dangling somewhere, store in on the inside of the desk. Also, remove the Mac mini from the inside of the desk, after disconnecting all cables.

That's it. The desk should now be freely movable and can be put to the side. Make sure it is out of the way for now. When moving the desk, take care to lift it using the lower plate of the worktop, as the upper one is not bolted to the rest of the desk.

### Dismantling the tracks

The tracks form an intricate web that is difficult to construct. Hence, please take care following the steps carefully and one-by-one, so that reconstructing the tracks is a feasible task.

Firstly, find the box of numbered pairs of IKEA clips. Then, attach a pair of clips to each rope and the corresponding steel cable it is attached to. Try to attach the clip on the steel cable as close as possible to the position where the rope is attach to the steel cable. Ensure the numbers on the clip are matching and don't disconnect any ropes until all of them have a clip on them.

Afterwards, all tracks should be removed one-by-one. It's best to remove them in the order they were installed in. Refer to the attached Track list and build order for the installation order. Remove the tracks with build order number 3 first, then 2 and lastly 1. For removing a single track, follow the next paragraph. Always remove a track with at least two persons.

The receiving prongs for the slinky are quite brittle. Please take care when removing tracks and bunching them up that they don't break.

Firstly, one by one, remove the ropes from the hooks attached to the steel cables. Bunch up the ropes and put them inside of the track. Ensure that the rope hold is attached to the track. If it is not properly attached, use a piece of painter's tape to make sure it stays in the exact same place when being moved. Leave the hooks hanging on the steel cable for now.

Track segments should never be disconnected. They should be transported as one single piece.

Secondly, manoeuvre the track out of the installation. This might entail making some weird twister moves in order to get it out in a single piece. The start of the track is locked into a terminal by friction fit. You can remove it by lifting the end of the first segment into the air and wiggling the track out.

Thirdly, pack up the tracks segments in a single package using the rope. Make sure that it's safe for transportation, paying special attention to the prongs on the receiving slinky piece. Also, ensure that the tracks are sorted into their respective build order groups.

Rinse and repeat until all tracks are removed from the installation.

### Removing the terminals

As soon as all tracks have been disconnected from the terminals, the terminals can be removed from the installation as well. Before starting to remove individual terminals, cut all tie-wraps connecting ethernet and power cables to the superstructure.

Firstly, remove the white power cords from each power strip. These cords connect the terminal's power through to each other. Coil up the power cord belonging to a terminal and put it on one of the hooks for the outgoing tracks.

Secondly, coil up the ethernet cable going to the terminal, and place it on another hook for one of the incoming tracks. Don't add the coil to the existing coil on the underside of the screen, as the cable lengths have been closely calibrated.

Now that the terminal is fully disconnected, you can remove it from the circle. Terminals should always be transported fully assembled.

### Dismantling the superstructure

The superstructure consists of a centre piece, to which three side beams are connected. At the end of these horizontal beams are side plates, to which vertical beams are attached. The assembly of a sidebeam, a vertical beam and two side plates is called a leg.

The superstructure is heavy and dangerous. It must be assembled / disassembled by a team of at least four people.

Find the wooden attachments for the lifting tripods. Then, position each of three lifting tripods under a horizontal beam, and gently lift them so that they barely lift the superstructure of off the ground.

Secondly, remove all stainless steel cables and support beams. Remove the cables by relaxing the wire strainer and removing the cables from the hooks. Remove the beams by using an Allan key to loosen the center connector piece.

Thirdly, remove one of the legs by loosening the bolts. Take off the leg first, and then remove the plates one-by-one. Rinse and repeat for the two remaining legs until all side plates and vertical beams are removed. Then, lower the remaining assembly using the lifting tripods, as low as they can go. Lift what remains of the superstructure from the lifting tripods and place it on the ground. You can now remove the vertical pieces from the center piece by loosening the bolts and pulling the beam out. 

The superstructure is now fully disassembled and ready for transportation.
